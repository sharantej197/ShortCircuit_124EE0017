# concept & idea:
In this task I have done the given task with another perspective it works differently than the traditional one (which the SHORTCIRCUIT team has give)

CONCEPT:
         I have used the microproccesing power of the arduino to glow up different lights at various times and for specific time intervals 
         PUSH button for giving start or stop signal when the  circumstances are ready to control the traffic light system. The specifications 
         according to my THEME of my task are customised by the ARDUINO code, In this code used static bool,digitalWrite,digitalRead,etc.

IDEA   : 
         my ideology for this specific task is when a group or a person ( The simulation generated by me whose link is
         above is best suits for a group crossing road, also for single pedestrian   ) wants to cross a road he push the start button 
         red LED glows which leads to stop the coming vehicles and it stays glowing for the average time of crossing the road (based on the width 
         of the road and it is not fixed that is, It is customozable for a particular road) and after the time the yellow LED starts glowing(led red goes OFF)
         without any prompt from the pedestrains.Upto now crossing of the road is completed the time for LED yellow glowing is until the pedestrain
         reaches the STOP button and push it. After the push green LED glows(led yellow goes OFF) it stays for 1000millisecs and turns off and finally whole 
        system goes to sleep condition.

#DUALITY: 

Not only for the pedestrain crossing this system can be further integrated to four way intersection roads by replacing the human manual button pressing 
with some camera,RADAR to judge traffic and switch the light accordingly.This system avoids the unneccesary waiting where there there is no  traffic.
